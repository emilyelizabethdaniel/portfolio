# portfolio
This projects objective was to make a portfolio webpage with clickable images that lead to published works. This webpage should use flex, responsive screen design and clickable links that bring the reader to the specific location on that page. 

## method
For this project I build my page to have to body of the page a complete flex box, and have nested the aside part of my webpage and the images together as their own flexboxes so they end up in a row. For my images I increased the size of the first image to make it larger than the rest using flexbox. The first three images have links to depolyed github projects from this bootcamp. For the rest of the images I liked them to my github. I have a form for the contact link. I added a title, image of me and short lorem ipsum description for the left column. Added some styling elements, used over in multiple spots. Styled footer and header. Added classes for colors in css. Added descriptive comments. All images have alt descriptions. 

## Updated Portfolio
I updated this portfolio by adding new links to github projects, linked in my linkedin and resume. Updated LinkedIn and followed people on github.
